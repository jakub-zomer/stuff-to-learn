*	SUM CALC is a tool to calculate sum of either geometric or arithmetic sequence with user defined input. It is build with two methods, **GEOMETRIC** and **ARITHMETIC**, both of them can be called in **MAIN** 
*	*GEOMETRIC* is a method called by user input from **main**, method requires user input for three values. Value **a** for 1st element of the sequence, value **q** for the multiplier of value **a**, and value **n** for the number of repetitions in the sequence.
*   **ARITHMETIC** is a method called by user input from **main**, requires  input for value **a** for 1st element, **diff** for differnce between the elements, and **n** for the number of repetitions in the sequence.
